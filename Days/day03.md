# what is the Red and Blue Team?

**Red** and **Blue** teams work as attackers and defenders in the security space to improve an organisation's security.

Both teams work toward improving an organisation's security posture differently.

The **Red** team has the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities in code or infrastructure and attempting to break through cybersecurity defences.

The **Blue** team defends against those attacks and responds to incidents when they occur.

# ****Benefits of a red team vs. blue team approach****

One way organizations can assess their security capabilities is to stage a red team/blue team exercise. These two teams of professionals face off to put a security infrastructure to the test in a simulation meant to mimic a real attack. Taking a red team versus blue team approach to cybersecurity can have several benefits, allowing security teams to:

- Find vulnerabilities
- Strengthen network security
- Build experience in detecting and containing attacks
- Develop response plans and procedures
- Create healthy competition and cooperation
- Raise security awareness among other staff

# What is Red Team?

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines a **red team**
 as “a group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture.” The red team plays the part of the attacker or competitor with the intention of identifying vulnerabilities in a system.

## Read team **activities**

When you’re part of a red team, you’re tasked with thinking like a hacker in order to breach an organization’s security (with their permission). Some common red team activities include:

- Social engineering
- Penetration testing
- Intercepting communication
- Card cloning
- Making recommendations to the blue team for security improvements

# ****What is a blue team?****

NIST defines a **blue team** as “the group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers.” If the red team is playing offense, the blue team is playing defence to protect an organization’s critical assets.

# **Blue team activities**

As a blue team member, it’s your job to analyze the current security posture of your organization and take measures to address flaws and vulnerabilities. Playing for the blue team also means monitoring for breaches and responding to them when they do occur. Some of these tasks include:

- Digital footprint analysis
- DNS audits
- Installing and configuring firewalls and endpoint security software
- Monitoring network activity
- Using least-privilege access
