 # Secure Coding Review
Secure code review is the process of examining and evaluating the security of a software application or system by reviewing the source code for potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This process is an essential part of ensuring that an application is secure and can withstand attacks from cyber criminals.

There are several steps involved in a secure code review process:

Identify the scope of the review: The first step is to identify the scope of the review, including the type of application being reviewed and the specific security concerns that need to be addressed.
Set up a review team: A review team should be composed of individuals with expertise in different areas, such as security, coding, and testing. The team should also include individuals who are familiar with the application being reviewed.
Prepare the code for review: Before the review can begin, the code needs to be prepared for review by organizing it in a way that makes it easier to understand and review. This may include breaking the code down into smaller chunks or adding comments to explain the purpose of specific sections.
Conduct the review: During the review, the team will examine the code for vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This may include checking for insecure coding practices, such as hardcoded passwords or unencrypted data, or looking for vulnerabilities in the application’s architecture.
Document findings: As the team identifies potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses, they should document their findings in a report. The report should include details about the vulnerability, the potential impact, and recommendations for how to fix the issue.
Remediate vulnerabilities: Once the review is complete, the team should work with the development team to fix any vulnerabilities or weaknesses that were identified. This may involve updating the code, implementing additional security controls, or both.
There are several tools and techniques that can be used to facilitate a secure code review. These may include:

Static analysis tools: These tools analyze the code without executing it, making them useful for identifying vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
Dynamic analysis tools: These tools analyze the code while it is being executed, allowing the review team to identify vulnerabilities that may not be detectable through static analysis alone.
Code review guidelines: Many organizations have developed guidelines for conducting code reviews, which outline the types of vulnerabilities that should be looked for and the best practices for remediation.
Peer review: Peer review is a process in which other developers review the code, providing a second set of eyes to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Secure code review is an ongoing process that should be conducted at various stages throughout the development lifecycle. This includes reviewing code before it is deployed to production, as well as conducting periodic reviews to ensure that the application remains secure over time.

Overall, secure code review is a critical component of ensuring that an application is secure. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities early in the development process, organizations can reduce the risk of attacks and protect their systems and data from potential threats. Secure Coding Review
